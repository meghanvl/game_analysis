Observable Trends:

1. The most profitable item and the most popular item both fall under the Item Name "Final Critic". That is something I would prioritize, especially when compared to items that were not doing very well like "Trickster" and "The Decapitator".
2. The age range of 40+ does not spend much money and I would compare their purchase count to the Item Name to see what they are choosing to purchase.  
3. We can quickly see that the total males to total females is hugely different and the total purchase value is much greater in males, but the average total per person in males and females is very similar. Again I would look at what items they are buying to find out if there is an untapped market for the females. 
4. The average total per purchase is highest for the age range 35-39 which makes me think they are ok with spending a bit more for what they really want.
